JGS GitHub Entrance Exam

No more than one or two sentences per question. Email completed exam to dev.joegamesaga@gmail.com. You must get four of five questions per section correct and a final score of 20 or higher to be considered as a collaborator to the github.com/JoeGameSaga/HEX repository. Included are the most excellent learning resources I have found. See you on the other side! -Joseph
